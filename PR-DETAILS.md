## Overview

Automated blockchain-based royalty distribution system for artists and creators, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring transparent, instant payments.

## Problem Solved

The music and creative industries lose 45% of $12B+ annual revenue to intermediaries, with payment delays averaging 6+ months. This creates:
- Delayed compensation for artists

- Lack of transparency in royalty tracking
- High administrative overhead

## Solution

Smart contract that automates royalty distribution with:
- **Instant Payments**: Automatic distribution when content is used
- **Transparent Tracking**: Immutable blockchain records
- **Accurate Splits**: Pre-defined percentages ensure fair distribution
- **Direct Compensation**: Eliminates intermediary fees
